# Yuanjian's Personal Website

This project contains the static files and code for generating my personal website [yuanjianliu.net](https://www.yuanjianliu.net). The page design is based on [Jekyll Chirpy Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

## Get Started

The website is built on top of jekyll, so please follow [jekyll's official website](https://jekyllrb.com/) to see how to install the tools and how it works.

To make things simple, you can run the following two lines of commands to serve the website in [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000).

> If you see a lot of errors, you probably have not installed Ruby and other jekyll's dependencies.

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll s
```
