abstract: Existing state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy compressors, however, do not support multi-range based error-bounds in the lossy compression, leaving a critical gap that hampers their effective use in practice. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a multi-range based error-bounded lossy compressor based on the state-of-the-art SZ lossy compressor. Our approach allows users to set different error bounds in different value ranges for a compressoin task.
