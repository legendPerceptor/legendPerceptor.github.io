abstract: Storing and archiving data produced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a huge burden for research institutions. Reference-based compression algorithms are effective in dealing with these data. Our work focuses on compressing FASTQ format files with an improved reference-based compression algorithm to achieve a higher compression ratio than other state-of-the-art algorithms. We propose FastqZip which uses a new method mapping the sequence to reference for compression, allows reads-reordering and lossy quality scores, and the BSC or ZPAQ algorithm to perform final lossless compression for a higher compression ratio and relatively fast speed.
