I enjoy photography and videography by a lot. I participate in student film production almost every quarter. I currently serve as the Tech Director in [Fire Escape Films](https://fireescapefilms.org/). I wrote and directed a film [Fall Into A Trap](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/900481142/7ef9906d1a) in the fall quarter of 2023. I just submitted it to several Film Festivals. Finger crossed that this film can reach a larger audience.

I am currently also learning to become a pilot. I usually fly Cessna 172 and Cherokee Piper. I am working on the Private Pilot License. Stay tuned, and if I got the license this year, I can fly you into the sky!

I also strive to make Youtube videos to share knowledge and happiness. If you don't want to miss a nice video, feel free to subscribe to my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVSC0Mlk2qw2ks8lVt1WzBw).
